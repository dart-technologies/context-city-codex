# Demo Runbook

## 60-Second Pitch
Traveling in a new city should feel effortless — but right now, tourists juggle Google Maps, Yelp, Eventbrite, and translation apps.

Our project is a Context-Aware City Concierge, powered by Codex, fronted by Dartagnan the Doodle—our friendly tour guide who narrates every step with the Codex as his trusty copilot.

It’s an agentic AI that knows where you are, what’s happening, and speaks your language. It doesn’t just answer — it plans, books, guides, and for every recommended POI it pulls in all relevant social feeds to stitch a delightful highlight video summary in your local language so you can feel the vibe before you arrive.

Imagine the World Cup Final in New York: La Roja supporters from Madrid and Les Bleus faithful from Paris land in Manhattan. In seconds, Dartagnan pops up with a tail-wagging greeting while the concierge streams a Spanish highlight reel for Mercado Little Spain, flips to a French reel for the Liberty State Park Fan Festival, then stitches breakfast, tapas, and watch-party stops into one itinerary before guiding them by NJ Transit to MetLife Stadium.

The magic? Multi-language, real-time events, social highlight reels, and local transit — all context-aware.

Today, we’ll demo how our concierge takes a tourist from “Plan my day” to “Book my table” to “Guide me to the stadium” in one seamless flow.

This is how we turn New York into a smart, welcoming city — for the World Cup, and for every visitor after.

## 60-Second Demo Script
- **0-10s**: Run `yarn demo:codex-nyc`; Dartagnan introduces himself on-screen while Codex Whisper plays a Spanish-captioned highlight video for Mercado Little Spain pulled from live social feeds.
- **10-20s**: Pop open the rationale drawer showing La Roja crowd sentiment, proximity, and accessibility signals that drove the recommendation.
- **20-30s**: Tap “Plan my day”; Dartagnan narrates as Codex drafts a timeline blending Spanish breakfast, Midtown tapas, and the Liberty State Park Fan Festival with a French-language preview.
- **30-40s**: Hit “Book my table”; agent secures a 1 PM slot at Felix in SoHo and surfaces the French confirmation with provenance log.
- **40-50s**: Select “Guide me”; display bilingual NJ Transit guidance to MetLife, flagging service delays and auto-offering rideshare fallback while Dartagnan highlights ADA callouts.
- **50-60s**: Trigger post-match celebration prompt recommending a Hudson River ferry party with localized Spanish and French summaries; flash repo + audit log proving the hackathon build, then return to Dartagnan waving goodbye.
