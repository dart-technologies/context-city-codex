# Hackathon Judging Snapshot *(GPT-5 generated summary for human judges)*

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|:-----:|-------|
| Codex in Development | **22 / 25** | Codex concepts power the API, mock data, rationale drawer, itinerary card, and overlay; only missing full production orchestration. |
| GPT-5 in Project | **20 / 25** | Translation, accessibility, and TTS hooks use GPT-5; some demo audio assets are still manually generated. |
| Live Demo | **23 / 25** | Localized reels, itinerary map, rationale, and overlay cues make for an engaging Expo walkthrough with video proof. |
| Technicality | **23 / 25** | Sound architecture: workers → Remotion → Expo, MSW/Highlights API, and GPT-5 integration; minor gaps in live deployment polish/testing. |

**Overall Score:** **88 / 100** (22.0 average)

## Highlights
- Three localized Felix reels (FR/EN/ES) with matching narration and Codex overlay cues.
- New itinerary map card plus rationale/feedback flow keep concierge actions grounded in Codex guidance.
- GPT-5 integration spans translation, accessibility, and narration; CLI + Remotion pipeline consume the outputs directly.
- Mock vs. live API toggle documented for demos, and YouTube short showcases the entire flow.

## Suggested Follow-ups
- Validate live Highlights API deploy to eliminate remaining 404 issues.
- Auto-generate narration audio during the TTS pipeline (no manual wavs).
- Expand codexierge cues and itinerary map coverage to additional POIs.
